scion-pki certificate template
------------------------------

Create subject template from a certificate or CSR

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~


'template' creates a subject template from a certificate, certificate chain, or CSR.

This command allows reconstructing the subject template that was used to create a certificate
or a certificate signing request (CSR). It is not necessary to use this command to create a
new certificate or CSR, as the template to the 'create' command can also be a certificate
itself.

In case the input is a certificate chain, the template is created from the first certificate
in the chain.
