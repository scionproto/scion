# M_COEF: the proportion by which memory performance contributes to throughput compared to
# arithmetic performance. NIC_CONSTANT: the fixed cost of the kernel interacting with the hardware
# to retrieve a frame. That one is hardware dependent and must be found by a third benchmark, so
# it is not theoretically a constant, but keeping it here to not forget. Until then, our performance
# index isn't really valid cross-hardware. M_COEF=400 gives roughly consistent results with the
# hardware we have. So, using that until we know more.

class RouterBM():
    """Evaluates the performance of an external router running the SCION reference implementation.

    The performance is reported in terms of packets per available machine*second (i.e. one
    accumulated second of all configured CPUs available to execute the router code).

    The router can actually be anything that has compatible metrics scrapable by
    prometheus. So that's presumably the reference implementation or a fork thereof.

    This test runs against a single router. The outgoing packets are not observed, the incoming
    packets are fed directly by the test driver (brload). The other routers in the topology are a
    fiction, they exist only in the routers configuration.

    The topology (./conf/topology.json) is the following:

    AS2 (br2) ---+== (br1a) AS1 (br1b) ---- (br4) AS4
                 |
    AS3 (br3) ---+

    Only br1a is executed and observed.

    Pretend traffic is injected by brload's. See the test cases for details.

    This class is a Mixin that borrows the following attributes from the host class:
    * coremark: the coremark benchmark results.
    * mmbm: the mmbm benchmark results.
    * intf_map: the map "label->actual_interface" map to be passed to brload.
    * brload: "localCmd" wraper for the brload executable (plumbum.machines.LocalCommand)
    * brload_cpus: [int] cpus where it is acceptable to run brload ([] means any)
    * artifacts: the data directory (passed to docker).
    * prom_address: the address of the prometheus API a string in the form "host:port"
