// Package routing defines implementations around the routing decisions for the
// gateway.
//
// This package defines the file format for the routing policies. A routing
// policy consists of a list of rules. Each rule consists of an action and three
// matchers. Optionally, a rule can have a comment that is persisted across
// deserialization and serialization.
//
// Policies are defined in plain text. Each line represents a rule. Each rule
// consists of four whitespace separated columns. The optional comment is
// appended at the end of the line and needs to start with a '#'.
//
//  accept       1-ff00:0:110     1-ff00:0:112    10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.0/24    # Accept from AS 110.
//  accept       2-0              1-ff00:0:112    10.0.3.0/24                # Accept from ISD 2.
//  reject       !1-ff00:0:110    1-ff00:0:112    10.0.0.0/8                 # Reject unless AS 110.
//  advertise    1-ff00:0:112     1-ff00:0:110    10.0.9.0/8                 # Advertise to AS 112.
//
// The first column represents the action. Currently, we support:
//
//  accept    <a> <b> <prefixes>: <b> accepts the IP prefixes <prefixes> from <a>.
//  reject    <a> <b> <prefixes>: <b> rejects the IP prefixes <prefixes> from <a>.
//  advertise <a> <b> <prefixes>: <a> advertists the IP prefixes <prefixes> to <b>.
//
// The remaining three columns define the matchers of a rule. The second and
// third column are ISD-AS matchers, the forth column is a prefix matcher.
//
// The second column matches the 'from' ISD-AS. The third column the 'to'
// ISD-AS. ISD-AS matchers support wildcards and negation:
//
//  1-ff00:0:110   Matches for 1-ff00:0:110 only.
//  0-ff00:0:110   Matches for all ASes with AS number ff00:0:110.
//  1-0            Matches for all ASes in ISD 1.
//  0-0            Matches for all ASes.
//
//  !0-ff00:0:110  Matches for all ASes except the ones with AS number 'ff00:0:110'.
//  !1-ff00:0:110  Matches for all ASes except 1-ff00:0:110.
//  !1-0           Matches for all ASes not in ISD 1.
//
// Network prefix matcher consist of a list of IP prefixes to match. The list is
// comma-separated. A prefix matches, if it is in the subset of the union of the
// IP prefixes in the list. The network prefix matcher can also be negated. The
// negation applies to the entire list. A prefix matches in the negated case, if
// it is not a subset of the union of the prefix list.
//
//  10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.0/24    Matches all IP prefixes that are a subset of 10.0.1.0/24 or
//                             10.0.2.0/24. It also matches 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24.
//  !10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.0/24   Matches all IP prefixes that are not a subset of 10.0.1.0/24 and
//                             not a subset of 10.0.2.0/24.
