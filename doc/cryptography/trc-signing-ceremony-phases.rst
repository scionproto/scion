TRC Signing Ceremony Phases
***************************

.. highlight:: bash

This documents outlines the steps each participant must go through when
participating in a TRC Signing Ceremony.

This document is organized by role. Please only refer to the section pertaining
to your role.

This document assumes that the basic devices required by the ceremony are present:

- Formatted USB Flash Drive (FAT)
- Ceremony administrator's device
- Voting representative's device

The script for each role is described in the following sections:

- :ref:`ceremony-administrator-role`
- :ref:`voting-as-representative-role`
- :ref:`witness-role`

Prior to the start, the *ceremony administrator* assigns a short identifier
to each *voting representative*. This identifier will later be used in the
naming of certain files. For the purpose of this document, the names are assumed
to be ``zürich``, ``bern``, and ``geneva``. Also for the purpose of this document,
``bern`` is assumed to be a Certificate Authority for the ISD.

.. _ceremony-administrator-role:

Ceremony administrator role
===========================

The ceremony administrator brings their own *ceremony representative's device*
to the ceremony. For readability, in this section we refer to this device simply
as the *device*.


Phase 1
-------

The *ceremony administrator* shares the *USB flash drive* with
each *voting representative*, and waits for each *voting representative*
to copy the needed certificates.

The *ceremony adminstrator* reminds participants that they need to copy all
certificates needed for the role of the entity they represent. For those who are
only voters, this means the *CP sensitive voting certificate* and the *CP
regular voting certificate*. For those who are also Certificate Authorities in
the ISD, the list of certificates includes the *CP root certificate*.

When the *ceremony administrator* gets the back the *USB flash drive*, they
connect it to their *device*. They must first check that all require certificates are
contained on the drive.

For each certificate, the *ceremony administrator* displays the validity period
and checks that they cover the previously agreed upon TRC validity.

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE display_validity START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE display_validity END

Further, check that the signature algorithms are correct:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE display_signature_algo START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE display_signature_algo END

And finally, check that the certificates are of valid type:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE validate_certificate_type START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE validate_certificate_type END

If the results of these checks are as expected, the *ceremony administrator*
computes the SHA256 sum for each certificate:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE certificates_digest START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE certificates_digest END

Disconnect the *USB flash drive*, and give it back to the *voting representatives*.
Wait for each *voting representative* to download the certificates of the other
*voting representatives*.

Finally, show the SHA256 sum on the screen for the *voting representatives* to
see, and wait for them to confirm that the SHA256 sum is correct for every
certificate.

After every *voting representative* has confirmed that the SHA256 sum is correct,
announce that **Phase 1** has concluded. If there is a mismatch in any of the sums,
**Phase 1** needs to be repeated.

Phase 2
-------

Once all the certificates have been accounted for, the *ceremony administrator*
must create a TRC payload.

First, ask the *voting representatives* for the ISD number of the new ISD. The
value will be used to fill in the ``{{.ISD}}`` variable below.

Second, ask the *voting representatives* for the description of the TRC. This
will be used to fill in the ``{{.Description}}`` variable below.

Third, ask the *voting representatives* for the AS numbers of the ASes that
will be core (these will be used to populate the ``{{.CoreASes}}`` variable in
the file below), and the AS numbers of the ASes that will be authoritative
(these will be used to populate the ``{{.AuthoritativeASes}}`` variable in the
file below).

Fourth, ask the *voting representatives* for the voting quorum of the new ISD.
The value will be used to fill in the ``{{.VotingQuorum}}`` variable below.

Last, ask the *voting representatives* for the validity period of the new ISD.
The value will be used to fill in the ``{{.NotBefore}}`` and ``{{.Validity}}``
variable below. The ``{{.NotBefore}}`` variable is represented as a UNIX
timestamp (seconds since Epoch January 1st, 1970 UTC, e.g. ``1593000000``
equals June 24th, 2020 UTC at noon).

To highlight variable types, we include some examples. The format must include
the part after the ``=`` sign exactly as it is written (i.e., with the exact
same quoting, parentheses, etc.).

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE payload_conf_sample START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE payload_conf_sample END
   :dedent: 2

.. note::

   The UNIX timestamp can be displayed in human readable form using the ``date``
   command::

       date -d @1593000000 --utc

   To compute the UNIX timestamp for a given date in UTC, use::

       date -d 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ' +"%s"

Create the TRC payload configuration:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE payload_conf START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE payload_conf END

Display the ``ISD-B1-S1.toml`` file with the variables filled-in on the *device*
monitor. The *voting representatives* should compare the contents of the file
with their answers to the previous questions, to ensure that all the data is
correct.

Once the data has been verified, compute the DER encoding of the TRC data:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE create_payload START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE create_payload END

Compute the SHA256 sum of the ``ISD-B1-S1.pld.der`` file using:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE payload_digest START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE payload_digest END

Connect the *USB flash drive* to your device, and copy the ``ISD-B1-S1.pld.der`` file to
the root directory, then disconnect the *USB flash drive*. Hand out the *USB flash drive*
to the *voting representatives*.

The *voting representatives* proceed to check the contents of the ``ISD-B1-S1.pld.der``
file by computing the SHA256 sum. Over the duration of the checks, keep the
SHA256 sum of the file available on the monitor for inspection.

This phase concludes once every *voting representative* confirms that the contents
of the ``ISD-B1-S1.pld.der`` are correct. Once that happens, announce that **Phase 2**
has successfully concluded.

Phase 3
-------

This phase consists of the *voting representatives* casting votes on the TRC
payload file (``ISD-B1-S1.pld.der``). The phase concludes after all *voting representatives*
have cast their votes and copied the signatures onto the *USB flash drive*.

As part of this phase, the *voting representatives* inspect the TRC payload.
Display the TRC payload using:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE display_payload START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE display_payload END
   :dedent: 4

Walk the *voting representatives* through the output and describe the meaning
and implications of each part.

Once every *voting representative* has finished the singing process, announce
that **Phase 3** has successfully concluded.

Phase 4
-------

This phase consists of assembling the final TRC by aggregating the payload data with
the votes (signatures) cast by the *voting representatives*.

Connect the *USB flash drive* to the *device*. Given the example data, the votes
should be available at the following locations on the *USB flash drive*:

- ``/bern/isd.sensitive.trc``
- ``/bern/isd.regular.trc``
- ``/geneva/isd.sensitive.trc``
- ``/geneva/isd.regular.trc``
- ``/zürich/isd.sensitive.trc``
- ``/zürich/isd.regular.trc``

To assemble the final TRC in a file named ``ISD-B1-S1.trc``, run the following command:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE combine_payload START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE combine_payload END

To check that the resulting TRC is correct, run:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE verify_payload START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE verify_payload END

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE verify_trc START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE verify_trc END
   :dedent: 4

Copy the ``ISD-B1-S1.trc`` file (the signed TRC) to the *USB flash drive* in the root directory.
Disconnect the *USB flash drive*.

Finally, compute the SHA256 sum of the final TRC:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE trc_digest START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE trc_digest END

and keep it for reference on the monitor of the *device*.

Each *voting representative* now checks that the final TRC contains the correct
data, and that it can be verified. Wait for each *voting representative* to
confirm that verification has finished successfully. If any verification fails,
**Phase 3** and **Phase 4** need to be repeated.

Furthermore, the *voting representatives* inspect that all signatures are present
Display the signed TRC with this command:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE display_signatures START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE display_signatures END
   :dedent: 4

Walk the *voting representatives* through the output and describe the meaning
and implications of each part.

If each *voting representative*
confirms they have successfully verified the TRC, announce that **Phase 4** has
finished successfully. Then, announce that the key signing ceremony has
concluded successfully.

.. _voting-as-representative-role:

Voting AS representative role
=============================

Each voting representative brings their own *voting representative's device* to
the ceremony. Each voting representative performs actions only on their own
device. For readability, in this section we refer to this device simply as the
*device*.

Preparation
-----------

To follow the commands described in the following sections, two environment
variables need to be set up:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE export_paths START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE export_paths END
   :dedent: 4

Furthermore, all everything that is copied from the *USB Flash Drive* should be
put in the current working directory.

.. important::

   It is required that the machine used to execute the commands has openssl
   version 1.1.1d or higher installed.

Phase 1
-------

Phase 1 consists of sharing the self-signed voting and root certificates.

Plug the *USB Flash Drive* into the *device*.

Create a new folder; use the identifier you received from the *ceremony
administrator* as the name of the folder (e.g., if the identifier is ``zürich``,
the folder will have the same name).

Copy the *CP Sensitive Voting Certificate* and the *CP Regular Voting Certificate*
onto the *USB Flash Drive* into the newly created folder. The sensitive voting
certificate should be named ``sensitive-voting.crt``, and the regular voting
certificate should be named ``regular-voting.crt``.

.. Warning::

   Note that only the certificates must be shared during the step, not the private
   keys. Copying a private key by mistake invalidates the security of the ceremony.

If the entity you represent will also act as a CA in the new ISD, also copy
the *CP Root Certificate* to the *USB flash drive*. The file should be named
``cp-root.crt``.

Disconnect the *USB flash drive* from the *device*, and pass it to the next *voting
representative* or, if certificate copying has concluded, to the *ceremony administrator*.

Wait for the *ceremony administrator* to pass back the *USB flash drive*.
Connect the *USB flash drive* to the *device*, and copy the folders with the
certificates of the **other** *voting representatives*.
Disconnect the *USB flash drive*.

Wait for the *ceremony administrator* to announce the SHA256 sums for each
certificate. For each certificate, check carefully that the SHA256 sum announced
by the administrator matches the value computed on your copy of the certificate.

To compute the SHA256 on a Linux host, run the following commands from the
folder that contains the copied files.

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE certificates_digest START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE certificates_digest END

Furthermore, check that the certificate that is on the *USB flash drive* does
not differ from your own. For example, for identifier ``bern``, the command that should
be executed in the same folder as above is:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE diff_own_cert START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE diff_own_cert END

Phase 1 concludes once every participant confirms that the *ceremony administrator* has
the correct version of each certificate (that is, every SHA256 sum matches).

Phase 2
-------

In this phase, please answer the following questions asked by the *ceremony administrator*:

- What is the ISD number?
- What text description should the TRC contain? (e.g., "Swiss Medical ISD")
- Who will be the core ASes of the new ISD?
- Who will be the authoritative ASes of the new ISD?

.. .. warning::

   If ``no_trust_reset`` is set to true, all relying parties will reject any
   trust reset. This means that no new TRC update chain can be established. All
   TRC updates from this point forward will be rooted in this ceremony's base
   TRC. This closes the door for recovery from catastrophic key compromise, and
   is strongly discouraged.

If the answers from all *voting representatives* do not exactly match,
discussions are allowed to reach a common answer. If consensus cannot be
reached for a question, the ceremony is voided and no TRC is created.

After the *ceremony administrator* has collected all answers, they will produce a file
detailing TRC contents. Inspect the contents of the file carefully on the *ceremony
administrator*'s monitor, and point out any mistakes. If this verification succeeds,
the *ceremony administrator* will hand out the *USB flash drive*, which now contains the
TRC data.

Plug the *USB flash drive* into your device, copy the TRC file (it should be in the root
directory, called ``ISD-B1-S1.pld.der``) to your device, and disconnect
the *USB flash drive*. Compute the SHA256 sum on the file by executing the following command
from the folder that contains the copied file:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE payload_digest START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE payload_digest END

Compare the result of the command with the SHA256 sum displayed on the monitor of the
*ceremony administrator*. If there are any differences, this phase needs to be restarted.

This phase concludes once all *voting representatives* confirm that the
``ISD-B1-S1.pld.der`` file has the correct digest.

Phase 3
-------

This phase consists of signing the TRC file. Two signatures need to be computed,
one using the *regular voting certificate* and one using the *sensitive voting certificate*.

Before signing, check that the TRC payload is sound:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE display_payload START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE display_payload END
   :dedent: 4

To compute the signatures, run:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE sign_payload START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE sign_payload END
   :dedent: 4

.. Warning::

   The above operation requires access to the private key. If this key gets leaked, it may
   compromise the security of the ISD. Make sure no other operations read this key.

To sanity check that the signatures were created correctly, run:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE check_signed_payload START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE check_signed_payload END
   :dedent: 4


Connect the *USB flash drive* to the *device*, and copy ``ISD-B1-S1.regular.trc`` and
``ISD-B1-S1.sensitive.trc`` to the folder named after your identifier.

Disconnect the *USB flash drive*, and hand it to the other *voting representatives*.

Phase 4
-------

This phase starts with the *ceremony administrator* aggregating the TRC payload and the votes.

Once the aggregation is finished, the *USB flash drive* will contain the final TRC.

Connect the *USB flash drive* to the *device*, and copy the ``ISD-B1-S1.trc`` file located in
the root of the *USB flash drive*.

Compute the SHA256 sum by navigating to the folder that contains the TRC file
and executing the following command:

.. literalinclude:: trc_ceremony.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE trc_digest START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE trc_digest END

Compare the result with what is displayed on the monitor of the *ceremony administrator*.
If the sum differs, then **Phase 3** and **Phase 4** need to be repeated.

Next, check that all the fields are consistent with earlier choices. To print the fields
that are present in the TRC, run:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE verify_trc START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE verify_trc END
   :dedent: 4

If there is a mismatch between any of the fields and the desired policy, then
**Phase 3** and **Phase 4** need to be repeated.

.. note::

   The ``-no_check_time`` flag is needed when the validity time of the TRC is in
   the future.

As a final check, run:

.. literalinclude:: crypto_lib.sh
   :start-after: LITERALINCLUDE display_signatures START
   :end-before: LITERALINCLUDE display_signatures END
   :dedent: 4

and check that the signature information of each signature is present; there should
be 2 signatures for each *voting representative*. If a signature is missing, then
**Phase 3** and **Phase 4** need to be repeated.

Inform the *ceremony administrator* of the outcome of the verification.

.. _witness-role:

Witness role
============

The role of the witness is to examine that the rules in this document are
followed by the participants. While not strictly required, it is useful if a
witness is familiar with the steps that both the *ceremony administrator* and
*voting representatives* must perform.

The witness has no active role in any of the steps of the ceremony, but can stop
the process and inquire for more information if they feel the integrity of the
process might have been compromised.

The witness should also be aware of what phase the ceremony is in, and take
notes on which phases completed successfully.
