# All this replicates the standard openwrt recipe to add and build a new package (one which
# code is already compiled). Two hacks in-there:
#
# * Because the openwrt src tree is full of dangling or circular symlinks, we can't run the
#   packaging steps in a sandbox (bazel can't clone the tree); we have to do it in-place.
# * Because we aren't sandboxed and the Makefiles aren't re-entrant, we can't build more than one
#   package at a time. To achieve that we serialize the packaging of each component by arbitrarily
#   depending on the previous one. For this to work, we have to declare the deps as inputs
#   eventhough we don't use them.
