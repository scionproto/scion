// Package sring (Slice Ring) implements a simple RingBuffer of interface{}
// entries. SRing is organized internally as two ring buffers, one containing
// entries with free space and one containing entries with data.
//
// New allocates entries internally.
//
// Writers gain exclusive access to free entries by calling Reserve, and submit
// the filled entries using Write. Writers can also choose to give back
// unneeded entries directly by calling Release.
//
// Readers gain exclusive access to data entries by calling Read. After
// processing the entries are marked as available again by calling Release. It
// is also valid for a reader to give up ownership by calling Write, although
// this is probably never useful.
//
// Note: SRing never modifies the entries itself, so any required resetting etc
// must be done by the caller(s).
//
// If Write or Release ever attempt to relinquish more entries than would fit
// into the ring buffers, an error is returned and no operation is performed.
// This is generally caused by a logic error in the caller.
