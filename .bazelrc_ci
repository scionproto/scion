# This file is used on the CI. We copy it to the home directory, which takes
# precedence over the worksapce rc file.
# We explicitly override --disk_cache to empty so that --remote_cache gets
# picked up. This is not documented but by testing we found that without
# overriding the --disk_cache the --remote_cache is ignored.
# --nostamp is required for better caching.
build --disk_cache= --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:9092 --nostamp
