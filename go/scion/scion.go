var filterHelp = `The paths can be filtered according to a sequence. A sequence is a string of
space separated HopPredicates. A Hop Predicate (HP) is of the form
'ISD-AS#IF,IF'. The first IF means the inbound interface (the interface where
packet enters the AS) and the second IF means the outbound interface (the
interface where packet leaves the AS).  0 can be used as a wildcard for ISD, AS
and both IF elements independently.

HopPredicate Examples:

  Match ISD 1: 1
  Match AS 1-ff00:0:133: 1-ff00:0:133 or 1-ff00:0:133#0
  Match inbound IF 2 of AS 1-ff00:0:133: 1-ff00:0:133#2,0
  Match outbound IF 2 of AS 1-ff00:0:133: 1-ff00:0:133#0,2
  Match inbound or outbound IF 2 of AS 1-ff00:0:133: 1-ff00:0:133#2

Sequence Examples:

  sequence: "1-ff00:0:133#0 1-ff00:0:120#2,1 0 0 1-ff00:0:110#0"

The above example specifies a path from any interface in AS 1-ff00:0:133 to
two subsequent interfaces in AS 1-ff00:0:120 (entering on interface 2 and
exiting on interface 1), then there are two wildcards that each match any AS.
The path must end with any interface in AS 1-ff00:0:110.

  sequence: "1-ff00:0:133#1 1+ 2-ff00:0:1? 2-ff00:0:233#1"

The above example includes operators and specifies a path from interface
1-ff00:0:133#1 through multiple ASes in ISD 1, that may (but does not need
to) traverse AS 2-ff00:0:1 and then reaches its destination on
2-ff00:0:233#1.

Available operators:

  ? (the preceding HP may appear at most once)
  + (the preceding ISD-level HP must appear at least once)
  * (the preceding ISD-level HP may appear zero or more times)
  | (logical OR)
