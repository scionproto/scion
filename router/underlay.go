// Link embodies the router's idea of a point to point connection. A link associates the underlay
// connection with a BFDSession, a destination address, etc. It also allows the concrete send
// operation to be delegated to different underlay implementations. The association between
// link and underlay connection is a channel, on the sending side, and should be a demultiplexer on
// the receiving side. The demultiplexer must have a src-addr:link map in all cases where links
// share connections.
//
// Regardless of underlay, links come in three scopes: internal, sibling, and external. The
// difference in behaviour is hidden from the rest of the router. The router only needs to
// associate an interface ID with a link. If the interface ID belongs to a sibling router, then
// the link is a sibling link. If the interface ID is zero, then the link is the internal link.
