This version of mbw is unmodified from the original. It exists here to simplify
its packaging in the context of the SCION build process. To that end, a
BUILD.bazel file was added. It is offered, of course, under the same GPL3.0
license that mbw comes with.

The rest of the SCION code does not depend on mbw. The SCION build packages
mbw for the same platforms that the SCION code supports for the convenience
of users.
