    A wrapper class for Zookeeper interfacing, using the `Kazoo python library
    <https://kazoo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.

    As Kazoo's functionality is mostly unaware of connection-state changes,
    it requires quite a bit of delicate code to make work reliably.

    E.g. Kazoo's Lock will claim to be held, even if the Zookeeper connection
    has been lost in the meantime. This causes an immediate split-brain problem
    for anything relying on that lock for synchronization. This is also,
    unfortunately, no way to inform the local Lock object that the connection
    is down and therefore the Lock should be released.

    All of Kazoo's events are done via callbacks. These callbacks must not
    block. If they do, no more Kazoo events can happen.

    E.g. if a watch callback blocks, disconnection callbacks will not run.
