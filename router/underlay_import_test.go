// This file exists for the sole purpose of importing underlayproviders, so white-box tests, which
// are part of the router package have working underlay providers without having to create
// mocks. Nothing in the router package can import an underlay provider, since non-trivial underlay
// providers have to import the router.
//
// This file has to be in the router_test package as this is the only package that can get mixed
// in the same test without the router package importing it.
//
// Outside of tests, underlay providers are imported by the main or config packages.
