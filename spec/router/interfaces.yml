    BFD:
      title: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection configuration of an interface.
      type: object
      required:
        - desired_minimum_tx_interval
        - detection_multiplier
        - enabled
        - required_minimum_receive
      properties:
        desired_minimum_tx_interval:
          description: >-
            The minimum interval between transmission of BFD control packets that the
            operator desires. This value is advertised to the peer, however the actual
            interval used is specified by taking the maximum of desired-minimum-tx-interval
            and the value of the remote required-minimum-receive interval value.
          type: string
          example: 200ms
        detection_multiplier:
          description: >-
            The number of packets that must be missed to declare this session as down. The
            detection interval for the BFD session is calculated by multiplying the value of
            the negotiated transmission interval by this value.
          type: integer
          example: 3
        enabled:

          type: boolean
          example: true
        required_minimum_receive:
          description: >-
            The minimum interval between received BFD control packets that this system should
            support. This value is advertised to the remote peer to indicate the maximum
            frequency (i.e., minimum inter-packet interval) between BFD control packets that
            is acceptable to the local system.
