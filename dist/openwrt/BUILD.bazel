# This BUILD file only takes care of hooking the assets derived
# from the openwrt SDK into the SCION bazel build.
#
# These assets are:
# * a cross-compilation toolchain that targets openwrt_<arch> (i.e. links with musl-libc).
# * openwrt (ipk) packaging of scion binaries built with the above.
#
# Turning these assets into bazel reeferencable dependencies happens in the context of the external
# src tree openwrt_<target>_SDK, which receives its own buildfile (BUILD.external.bazel, installed there by
# the http_archive target "openwrt_<target>_SDK" in //WORKSPACE).

# Some files that our openwrt build needs.
