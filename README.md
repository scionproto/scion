SCION
=====

An implementation of [SCION](http://www.scion-architecture.net), a future
Internet architecture.

* [docker/](/docker): support files to run SCION inside of Docker
  containers.
* [endhost/](/endhost): the parts of the code used on end hosts, e.g.
  `sciond`.
* [go/](/go): parts of the implementation that are written in
  [Go](http://golang.org).
* [infrastructure/](/infrastructure): the parts of the infrastructure
  implemented in Python.
* [lib/](/lib): the most relevant SCION libraries.
* [proto/](/proto): the protocol definitions for use with [Capâ€™n
  Proto](https://capnproto.org/).
* [sphinx-doc/](/sphinx-doc): the tools to generate the API
  documentation for the Python code.
* [sub/](/sub): the git submodules used by SCION
* [supervisor/](/supervisor): the configuration for
  [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/).
* [test/](/test): the unit tests for the Python code.
* [tools/](/tools): assorted support tools.
* [topology/](/topology): the scripts to generate the SCION
  configuration and topology files, as well as the certificates and ROT files

Necessary steps in order to run SCION:

1. Make sure that you are using a clean and recently updated **Ubuntu 16.04**.

1. Make sure that you have a
   [Go workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) setup, and that
   `~/.local/bin`, and `$GOPATH/bin` can be found in your `$PATH` variable. For example:

    ```
    echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> ~/.profile
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
    mkdir -p "$GOPATH"
    ```

1. Check out scion into the appropriate directory inside your go workspace (or
   put a symlink into the go workspace to point to your existing scion
   checkout):
   ```
   mkdir -p "$GOPATH/src/github.com/netsec-ethz"
   cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/netsec-ethz"
   git clone --recursive git@github.com:netsec-ethz/scion
   cd scion
   ```
   If you don't have a github account, or haven't setup ssh access to it, this
   command will make git use https instead:
   `git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git@github.com:`

1. Install required packages with dependencies:
    ```
    ./env/deps
    ```

1. Configure the host Zookeeper instance. At a minimum, add `maxClientCnxns=0`
   to `/etc/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg`, but replacing it with `docker/zoo.cfg` is
   recommended. This has the standard parameters set, as well as using a ram
   disk for the data log, which greatly improves ZK performance (at the cost of
   reliability, so it should only be done in a testing environment).

1. Create the topology and configuration files (according to
   `topology/Default.topo`):

    `./scion.sh topology`

    The resulting directory structure will be created:

        ./gen/ISD{X}/AS{Y}/
            {elem}{X}-{Y}-{Z}/
                as.yml
                path_policy.yml
                supervisord.conf
                topology.yml
                certs/
                    ISD{X}-AS{Y}-V0.crt
                    ISD{X}-V0.trc
                keys/
                    as-sig.key

   The default topology looks like [this](doc/fig/default-topo.pdf).

1. Run the infrastructure:

    `./scion.sh run`

1. Stop the infrastructure:

    `./scion.sh stop`

Notes about `topology/Default.topo`:

* `defaults.subnet` (optional): override the default subnet of `127.0.0.0/8`.

* `core` (optional): specify if this is a core AS or not (defaults to 'false').

* `beacon_servers`, `certificate_servers`, `path_servers`, `dns_servers` (all
  optional): number of such servers in a specific AS (override the default
  value 1).

* `links`: keys are `ISD_ID-AS_ID` (format also used for the keys of the JSON
  file itself) and values can either be `PARENT`, `CHILD`, `PEER`, or
  `CORE`.

## Tests

In order to run the unit tests:

  `./scion.sh test`
