0. Whats new in this version:
------------------------------

This is an incremental update version.  Both the C++ and Java versions
have been merged into a single framework.  The key new features are:

 (1) Two new generation models at both AS and Router levels:
 	(i)   Barabasi-Albert 2 (Like BA1, but allows rewiring)
	(ii)  GLP  (Bu-Towsley:Infocom02 paper)
 (2) New Export Capabilities to:
	(i)   NS-2 Simulator
	(ii)  SSFNet Simulator
	(iii) Javasim Simulator
	(iv)  Otter Visualization (improved)
 (3) New Import Capabilities from:
	(i)   CAIDA's Skitter Artsdump format
	(ii)  SCAN project maps (Mercator, Lucent Internet Mapping Project)

The BRITE Analysis Engine (BRIANA) is still being developed and is not
included in this version.  An alpha version will be ready soon.  If
you would like an early (early) alpha version, please email
anukool@cs.bu.edu.

1. Requirements:
-----------------

BRITE requires Java JDK 1.3 or higher to compile.  

If you want to use the C++ generation engine, then a ANSI-C++
compliant compiler is also needed for your platform.

BRITE will run on any platform that has both a JDK1.3 compliant VM and
an ANSI-C++ compliant compiler.  We have tested BRITE under Linux and
Solaris.  To compile BRITE under Windows, you will find the Cygwin
toolkit helpful.  Compiled binaries are available upon request, email
brite-developers@cs.bu.edu.


1. Installing:
----------------

To get BRITE up and running, change your working directory to the
location where you downloaded the tar.gz BRITE file.  Once there,
execute the following at the command prompt:
	
  $ gunzip BRITE.tar.gz
  $ tar xvf BRITE.tar.gz
  $ cd BRITE/   	
  $ make all	

To run BRITE with the GUI type:
  $ ./brite &

3.  More Documentation:
------------------------

While some of the details might be obsolete, we highly recommend that
you read the BRITE user manual to get the most out of BRITE.  This
manual describes the BRITE architecture and also includes sections on
installing, using and extending BRITE with examples.  The current
version of the user manual can always be downloaded (in Postscript or
PDF format) from http://www.cs.bu.edu/brite/docs.html.

You may also ask any questions about running BRITE at the BRITE-Users
mailing list. (see below)


4.  Contact Us:
----------------

There are likely to be many bugs :-) in this version.  If you find
bugs in BRITE, please email a detailed report describing the bug to
brite-developers@cs.bu.edu.

Also, if you have extended BRITE or written your own generation model,
please inform us at the same email address.  We maintain a repository
of contributed generation models and would like to incorporate your
generation model in future releases of BRITE.

For general questions about BRITE, please email the BRITE users
mailing list at brite-users@cs.bu.edu.  You are by default added to
this list when you download BRITE.  However, if you did not subscribe
to the list when you downloaded BRITE (or want to receive mail at a
different address), proceed as follows: Send a blank email to
brite-users-request@cs.bu.edu with the body of the email containing 
"subscribe".  This will add you to the list.

Once again, thank you for downloading BRITE.  Enjoy,
