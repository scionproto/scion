Dynamically Recreatable Key (DRKey) Infrastructure
**************************************************

This document presents the design for the Dynamically Recreatable Key (DRKey)
infrastructure.

Overview
========
The DRKey protocol enables routers and end hosts to derive cryptographic
symmetric keys on the fly from a single local secret.

DRKey is used for the following systems:

- SCION Packet Authenticator Option (SPAO)
- COLIBRI
- EPIC

Design
======

In the DRKey system, the key establishment is offloaded to the certificate service
(CS). The certificate service leverages efficient key derivation and
pseudorandom functions to derive keys in the hierarchy from top
to bottom.

The first secret in the hierarchy (:math:`SV_A`) is derived from a long-term ``master_secret``,
using a key derivation function. For the rest of the derivations, DRKey utilizes pseudorandom
functions, which are more efficient. Informally, key derivation functions output a cryptographic
key indistingushible from a random key if the secret is unknown for the attacker. In contrast,
the security of pseudorandom functions relies on the input being a uniformly random secret.


Derivation scheme
=================

We define two types of derivation: the :ref:`drkey-specific-derivation` derivation and
the :ref:`drkey-generic-derivation`. Both of them leverage the 4-level derivation scheme.

4-level derivation
------------------

**Secret value (Level 0)**

Each AS locally derives one :math:`SV_A^{protocol}` per protocol and epoch. This secret value
is renewed at every epoch and it is only shared with trustworthy entities that require
to derive keys on the fly for the specified protocol.

**AS-AS (Level 1)**

The ``AS-AS`` key is derived locally in the AS :math:`A` certificate server (:math:`CS_A`) and exchanged
with remote certificate servers. More specifically :math:`CS_A` shares :math:`K_{A,B}` with
:math:`CS_B`.

**host-AS (Level 2)**

The ``host-AS`` key is derived in the certificate servers using the Level 1 symmetric key.
It is intended to be used as an intermediate derivation allowing the node holding this
key to derive Level 3 keys locally.
Therfore, the key :math:`K_{A:H_A,B}` is only available to :math:`A:H_A` and trusted
infrastructure.

**AS-host (Level 2)**

The ``AS-host`` key is also derived in the certificate servers using the Level 1
symmetric key, however this key is intended to be used for communication.
In this case, the key :math:`K_{A,B:H_B}` is shared between :math:`AS_A` trusted nodes
and :math:`B:H_B`.

**host-host (Level 3)**

The ``host-host`` key is derived in :math:`H_A` and :math:`CS_B` using the ``host-AS`` key. This key
is available to both hosts :math:`H_A` and :math:`H_B`.

.. _drkey-specific-derivation:

Protocol-specific derivation
----------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 100 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Identifier
     - Derivation
     - Name
   * - :math:`SV_A^{protocol}`
     - :math:`KDF(input)`
     - Secret value (Level 0)
   * - :math:`K_{A,B}^{protocol}`
     - :math:`PRF_{SV_A^{protocol}}(type||B)`
     - AS-AS key (Level 1)
   * - :math:`K_{A,B:H_B}^{protocol}`
     - :math:`PRF_{K_{A,B}^{protocol}}(type||H_B)`
     - AS-host key (Level 2)
   * - :math:`K_{A:H_A,B}^{protocol}`
     - :math:`PRF_{K_{A,B}^{protocol}}(type||H_A)`
     - host-AS (Level 2)
   * - :math:`K_{A:H_A,B:H_B}^{protocol}`
     - :math:`PRF_{K_{A:H_A,B}^{protocol}}(type||H_B)`
     - host-host (Level 3)

The ``input`` in :math:`KDF(input)` is defined as
``input = "len(master_secret) || master_secret || protocol || epoch_begin || epoch_end"``.
`protocol` is defined as a 2-byte identifier.

The key notation states for which entity the key derivation must be efficient.
The term in the left identifies the key *issuer* (the fast side in the derivation),
whereas the right term identifies the key *subject* (the slow side in the derivation).
For example, :math:`K_{A,B:H_B}` can be used in both communication directions,
but it is directly derivable by :math:`AS_A`, whereas the :math:`AS_B` requires to contact
:math:`CS_A` to fetch the intermediate Level 1 key.

The PRF derivation for every key includes the *type* (``AS-AS``, ``AS-host``,
``host-AS`` and ``host-host``). This enables domain separation among computed
keys. For instance, it outputs (with high probability)
:math:`K_{A:H_A,B} â‰  K_{A,B:H_B}` when :math:`H_A==H_B`.

.. _drkey-generic-derivation:

Generic-protocol derivation
---------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Identifier
     - Derivation
     - Name
   * - :math:`SV_A`
     - :math:`KDF(input)`
     - Secret value (Level 0)
   * - :math:`K_{A,B}`
     - :math:`PRF_{SV_A}(type||B)`
     - AS-AS key (Level 1)
   * - :math:`K_{A,B:H_B}^{protocol}`
     - :math:`PRF_{K_{A,B}}(protocol||type||H_B)`
     - AS-host key (Level 2)
   * - :math:`K_{A:H_A,B}^{protocol}`
     - :math:`PRF_{K_{A,B}}(protocol||type||H_A)`
     - host-AS (Level 2)
   * - :math:`K_{A:H_A,B:H_B}^{protocol}`
     - :math:`PRF_{K_{A:H_A,B}^{protocol}}(type||H_B)`
     - host-host (Level 3)

This derivation scheme allows applications to define "niche" protocols. By including
the protocol in the Level 2 derivation input.

Key Validity time
=================

Epochs
------
An epoch is an interval between a starting and ending point in time. The epoch
length can be chosen by a given AS and can change over time, however, epochs
must not overlap. Thus, a secret value is associated with exactly one epoch.

In the design, every AS can define different epoch lengths for each
protocol-specific 0th level key.

Defining a reasonable lower bound for the epoch length used in DRKey
is necessary to avoid nonsensical scenarios. This value is
globally set to 6 minutes.

.. note::

  This lower bound might be changed in the future in case a more suitable
  value is found.

Grace period
------------
We define a short overlapping period in which the protocol accepts packets with the key
for the previous epoch *i-1* and also for the current one *i*. This period should be
ideally as short as possible, although long enough to allow using the same key for
single packet request/response use cases (e.g. a few seconds). Thus, we set
``GRACE_PERIOD = 5 seconds``.

.. _drkey-prefetching:

Prefetching period
------------------
ASes will be allowed to prefetch keys some time before the key for the current epoch expires.
This period must be long enough to allow every remote AS to attempt the key prefetching
enough times to be succesful even in the presence of failures. However, this period
should not be too long, since the issuer AS is not assumed to carry out any changes
once it has issued keys for a given epoch (e.g. modifying SV epoch duration,
rotating the master secret, etc.).

We suggest globally setting  ``PREFETCHING_PERIOD = 30 minutes``.

.. note::

  Whether ASes are allowed to request/serve keys for past epochs is up for discussion.

Key establishment
=================

Level 1 key establishment
-------------------------

The Level 1 key establishment occurs between certificate servers located in different ASes.
The subject-AS on the slow side (i.e. the AS requesting the key) will establish a TLS secure connection with
the issuer-AS  on the fast side (i.e. the AS serving the key). Both parties identify each other by using
the CP-PKI infrastructure.

The Level 1 key request message contains the ``validTime`` for which the key must be active
and the ``protocol_id``. The Level 1 key response includes the symmetric key along with the epoch
for which this key will be valid.

The ``protocol_id`` is either set to ``GENERIC = 0`` to request Lvl1 keys that will be derived according to
the `generic-protocol` hierarchy or to the protocol number for the `protocol-specific` derivation.

Level 0/2/3 level key establishment
-----------------------------------

Even though Level 0/2/3 key exchange happens within the same AS (i.e. intra-AS communication),
the protocol should establish a secure channel. This would avoid that unintended hosts in the
AS can eavesdrop on symmetric keys that are not intended to them.

The certificate server will only respond to the specific request if the requesting host
is authorized to receive the requested key. This is especially important in the Level 0 key
case since only trustworthy nodes should be authorized to receive this key.

The Level 0 key request contains the `validTime` and the specific ``protocol_id``. The certificate
server responds with the SV and the epoch for which this key will be valid.

The Level 2/3 key request includes the `validTime` and the necessary host and AS
information (depending on the key type). The server responds with the symmetric
key and the epoch.

The ``protocol_id`` in Lvl2/3 requests is always set to the final protocol identifier.
The key service will choose between the `protocol-specific` derivation, if it exists, or
the `generic-protocol` derivation, otherwise.

Spreading Level 1 key requests
==============================

Shared symmetric keys are short-lived to avoid explicit key revocation. In order
to avoid peaks in the requests for Level 1 keys derived from a given SV, every requesting
CS (i.e. the CS on the slow side) SHOULD wait a random time before trying to prefetch
the Level 1 key. This time ``t`` is u.r.d. in the interval [0, 15] minutes.

In this manner, the CS on the slow side SHOULD NOT request a Level 1 key before
``epoch_end - (PREFETCHING_PERIOD - t)`` instant in time (the ``PREFETCHING_PERIOD``
is defined in :ref:`drkey-prefetching`).

Key exchange message format
