// Package processmetrics provides a custom collector to export process-level metrics beyond what
// prometheus.ProcesssCollector offers.  This implementation is restricted to Linux. The generic
// implementation does nothing.
//
// The metrics we add serve to estimate the available cpu time; that is, the amount of CPU that the
// scheduler granted to the process, independently of whether it ran with it or slept on it. The
// goal is to measure what the overall performance of the process would be if it was never
// preempted. For example, this could be expressed as some_output/available_cpu_time.
//
// At a given time, a given thread is either running, runnable, or sleeping. When running it
// consumes exactly one core. When runnable, it is being deprived of exactly one core (because Go
// does not create more runnable threads than there are cores, there is no other thread of that
// process that is receiving it.). So, for our accounting purposes, the total time that all the
// process's threads spend "runnable" is the total core*time that the process did not receive. The
// complement of that: the available_cpu_time is: num_cores * real_time - total_runnable_time.
//
// We expose only running and runnable times. Available time can be inferred more conveniently in
// prometheus queries depending on the desired unit. For example:
// * available_cpu_seconds_per_seconds = num_cores - rate(process_runnable_seconds_total)
// * available_machine_seconds_per_seconds = 1 - rate(process_runnable_seconds_total)/num_cores
//
// Example of a query for processed_pkts per available cpu seconds:
//
//	rate(router_processed_pkts_total[1m])
//	  / on (instance, job) group_left ()
//	(num_cores - rate(process_runnable_seconds_total[1m]))
//
// Example of a query that only looks at on-cpu efficiency;
//
//	rate(router_processed_pkts_total[1m])
//	  / on (instance, job) group_left ()
//	(rate(process_running_seconds_total[1m]))
//
// The effective number of cores is best obtained from the go runtime. However, no prometheus
// collector seems to expose it yet, so we surface it here for convenience and simplicity
// under the name go_maxprocs_threads.
