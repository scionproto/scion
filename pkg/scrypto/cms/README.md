# CMS

[CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652) is a
syntax for signing, digesting, and encrypting arbitrary messages. It evolved
from PKCS#7 and is the basis for higher level protocols such as S/MIME. This
package implements the SignedData CMS content-type, allowing users to digitally
sign data as well as verify data signed by others.

This package is based off [github/cms](https://github.com/github/cms) and
contains the license from that repository.
