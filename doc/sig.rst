SCION-IP Gateway

Introduction
============

The SCION IP Gateway (SIG) enables IP packets to be tunneled over SCION to support communication between hosts that do not run a SCION implementation. A SIG acts as a router from the perspective of IP, whilst acting as SCION endpoint from the perspective of the SCION network. It is typically deployed inside the same AS-internal network as its non-SCION hosts, or at the edge of an enterprise network.

Tunneling IP traffic over SCION requires a pair of SIGs and it involves the following steps:

1. A sender sends an IP packet towards an IP destination.

2. The IP packet reaches a SIG in the senderâ€™s network via standard IP routing.

3. Based on the destination IP address, the source (ingress) SIG determines the destination (egress) SIG's ISD-AS endpoint address. To achieve this, SIGs are administratively configured with a set of partner ASes and discover SIGs present at these ASes. They then exchange IP prefixes. The description of that protocol is yet to be written.

4. The ingress SIG encapsulates the original IP packet within one or more SCION packets and sends them to the egress SIG. If necessary, the ingress SIG performs SCION path lookups and selects a SCION path to the egress SIG.

5. The egress SIG receives the SCION packet or packets and decapsulates the original IP packet. It then forwards the packet to the final IP destination using standard IP routing.

This protocol is designed to:

- provide independence from the underlying SCION path MTU which can increase and decrease over time.
- provide fast detection of packet loss and subsequent recovery of decapsulation for packets that weren't lost.
- support for multiple streams within a framing session such that independent packet sequences be tunneled in parallel.


SIG Framing Protocol
====================

IP packets are encapsulated into SIG frames, which are sent as SCION/UDP datagrams.

There may be multiple IP packets in a single SIG frame, and a single IP packet may be split into multiple SIG frames.

The ingress SIG initiates unidirectional packet flows to the egress SIG simply by sending the corresponding SIG frames. There is no handshake. The egress SIG, should it accept the traffic, instantiates the necessary resources on-demand to process each flow. Each such flow forms an independent sequence of packets (a stream) ordered by an incrementing sequence number. Between a given SIG ingress/egress pair, a (session ID, stream ID) pair uniquely identifies a stream.

To preserve performance, IP packets that form a sequence leave the egress SIG in the order in which they entered the ingress SIG. To that end:

- The ingress SIG encapsulates IP packets that cannot be proven independent (e.g., with the same  IP 6-tuple) in the same stream.
- The ingress SIG encapsulates IP packets to a given stream in the order in which they were received.
- The ingress SIG sends all frames of a given stream over the same SCION path.
- The egress SIG reassembles and forward packets from each stream, ordered by frame sequence number and by packet within each frame.

The session ID part of the (session ID, stream ID) pair has an implementation defined meaning. Existing implementations use different session IDs for different traffic classes: the ingress SIG is responsible for assigning a traffic class. On the egress SIG side, the session ID may inform the processing of frames and enables per-class metrics.

SIG Frame Header
----------------

Each SIG frame starts with SIG frame header with the following format::

   0                   1                   2                   3

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |   Reserved (12 bits)    |        Stream ID (20 bits)          |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                                                               |
  +                       Sequence number                         +
  |                                                               |

All fields within SIG frame header are in network byte order.

- ``Version`` (8 bits) indicates the SIG framing version. It MUST be set to zero if following this specification.
- ``Session ID`` (8 bits) identifies a tunneling session between a pair of SIGs.
- ``Index`` (16 bits) is the byte offset of the first beginning of an IP packet within the payload. If no IP packet starts in the payload, e.g. if the frame contains only the middle or trailing part of an IP packet, the field MUST be set to 0xFFFF.
- ``Reserved`` (12 bits): it MUST be set to zero.
- ``Stream ID`` (20 bits), along with the session, it identifies a unique sequence of SIG frames. Frames from the same stream are, on the egress SIG, put into the same reassembly queue. There may be multiple streams per session.
- ``Sequence Number`` (64 bits) indicates the position of the frame within a stream. Consecutive frames of a given stream have consecutive sequence numbers. IP packets split among multiple frames are re-assembled by concatenating the payloads of consecutive frames.

A SIG MAY drop frames. In the current implementation, the egress SIG does not buffer frames that are received out-ot-order. Instead it drops any out-of-order and following frames until it finds the begining of a new encapsulated IP packet.

SIG frame payload
-----------------

The SIG frame payload may contain multiple IPv4 or IPv6 packets, or parts
thereof. No other types of packets can be encapsulated. The packets are
placed one directly after another, with no padding.
Multicast traffic is not supported yet.

SIG uses IPv4/6 "payload length" field to determine the size of the packet.
To make the processing easier, it is required that the fixed part of the IP header
is in the frame where the IP packet begins. In other words, the initial fragment
of an IPv4 packet must be at least 20 bytes long. The initial fragment of an IPv6
packet must be at least 40 bytes long.

Example
-------

Following example shows three IP packets packed into three SIG frames::

  +----------------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------------+
  | SIG HDR Index=0 Seq=0      | IP4 HDR | payload | IP6 HDR | payload...     |
  +----------------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------------+

  +----------------------------+-----------------+---------+------------------+
  | SIG HDR Index=8 Seq=1      | ...payload (8B) | IP4 HDR | payload...       |
  +----------------------------+-----------------+---------+------------------+

  +----------------------------+------------+
  | SIG HDR Index=0xffff Seq=2 | ...payload |
  +----------------------------+------------+
