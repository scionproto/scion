# Path Service Design (Go)

## Request Handlers

The path server (PS) needs to handle multiple requests. We use the messenger to register request
handlers. The following requests need to be handled:

* __TRC Request:__ Use handler of existing truststore.
* __Chain Request:__ Use handler of existing truststore.
* __Path Registration:__ A handler for the existing path-registration request should be implemented.
* __Path Requests:__ A handler for the existing `SegReq` should be implemented.
* __Path Revocation:__ A handler for the existing path-revocation message should be implemented.
* __Path Changes Since:__ Used for the new replication of down-segments. The service should return
  all the ids of changed segments since a certain point in time. The requesting PS can then request
  the affected segments. The python server will not support this mechanism but we will receive the
  old path sync message from it, so this is not a big problem.

## Deletion of Expired Path Segments and Revocations

The PS should periodically delete expired path segments and revocations in its DB.

## Path Lookup

### Logic Flow

Local means in the same ISD as the current PS, remote means in a different ISD.

#### Common Logic

* Receive path request R of type SegReq
* For non-core PS: Check source (R.RawSrcIA): must either be unset, or set to the local IA otherwise
  return an error/empty reply
* Check destination (R.RawDstIA):
    * If the R.RawDstIA is not set or invalid (i.e., ISD is 0) or represents the local IA,
      immediately return an error/empty reply
* Define `GetCached(Seg, cPS)` := if last lookup Seg.Dst is longer than a configured time ago (Note
  comments on the cache refresh interval in chapter below), request at cPS and save result in cache,
  then return cached version. If we currently do not have a path to cPS we should hold the request
  until either we have a path or the request timed out.
* Request Paths: Note that results should always be filtered, any segments with revoked on-path
  interface should be dropped. See steps below.

#### Non-core PS

* If Dst == Core-AS:
    * For each local core-AS x, for which an up-segment exists && isNot(dst):
        * GetCached(coreSeg{dst->x}, x)
    * Return up-segments, which have a connecting core-segment or which end in dst, and the
        core-segments.
* Else // Dst == Non-Core-AS:
    * GetCached(downSeg{*->dst}, any local cPS)
    * Filter down-segments, remove revoked ones.
    * For each core AS x, that is at the start of a down-segment:
        * For each local core AS y, for which an up-segment exists && x != y:
          GetCached(coreSeg{x->y}, y)
    * Filter down-segments, only keep reachable ones
    * Return the down, core, and up-segments.

#### Core PS

* If destination is local:
    * If Dest is ISD-0: return empty
    * Else if Dest is core AS: return coreSeg{dst->self}
    * Else
        * If request from different AS: return downSeg{*->dst} (from DB)
        * Else return downSeg{*->dst} (from DB) and for each core AS x, that is at the start of a
          down-segment return the coreSegs{x->self}
* If destination is remote:
    * If Dest is ISD-0 return any coreSeg{ISD-*->self}
    * Else if Dest is core AS: return coreSeg{dst->self}
    * Else
        * If request from different AS: return GetCached(downSeg{*->dst}, any cPS in DestISD)
        * Else return GetCached(downSeg{*->dst}, any cPS in DestISD) and for each core AS x, that is
          at the start of a down-segment return the coreSegs{x->self}

### Cache Refresh Interval

If there are paths available for a certain destination an interval of, e.g. 5 min would be fine.
However if no paths are available we should retry more frequently, e.g. each second (maybe with
back-off). Also if there are less that k paths available in the cache we should also query the PS
again sooner than if enough paths are available.

### DoS / High-Load Prevention

A client could request paths to random (non-existing) ASes and with this put a lot of load on the
Path Service Infra. To prevent this we need caching of which ASes exist.
[scion#1486](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/issues/1486) Describes how we can find out if an AS
exists. A core PS that receives a path request for a non existing AS can reply with an error (AS
does not exist), the local PS can then cache this result, so it can immediately reply if the same
request is received again.

Also we should consider: [scion#1725](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/issues/1725)

### Policy

Path lookup should have policy support. Currently it is not yet clear what policies we might want.
For sure there has to be support for AS black-/white-listing. But the interface should be generic
enough to support more policies.

A note on caching: If we refresh the cache we might need to remember which policy was used for
updating the cache. It could be that for two policies we get a disjoint set of segments. Saving a
policy might impose a strong limitation on the expressionism of a policy.

## Revocations

Revocations can come from inside the ISD in form of a CtrlPld.PathMgmt.SRevInfo from the border
router, beacon service, or from the PS, or from anywhere in the form of an SCMP revocation, or if a
core PS requests down-segments of a core PS in another ISD the response should contain the relevant
revocations.

Note that, differing from the book, a revocation should no longer result in the deletion of a path
segment. Instead we only filter when using path segments.

### Logic Flow

* Receive revocation R
* If R is a CtrlPld.PathMgmt.SRevInfo && source is not in same ISD
    * Ignore R // SRevInfo should only come from within the same ISD.
* Verify R, if invalid drop it and return.
* Save R in the revocation cache
* Forward revocation in non-core PS:
    * If revoked interface belongs to this AS OR revocation is from a different ISD:
        * Inform all core PSes in the local ISD
* Forward revocation in core PS:
    * If revoked interface belongs to this AS OR Revocation is from a BR and it originated from a
      different ISD
        * Inform all other core ASes.
    * Note that if a cPS queries a cPS of another ISD for down-segments it should also get the
      relevant revocations for the segments. These revocations do not need to be forwarded to other
      cPSes.
