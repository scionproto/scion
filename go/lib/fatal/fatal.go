// Package fatal provides a way to handle fatal errors.
// 1. It gives the main goroutine an opportunity to cleanly shut down in case of a fatal error.
// 2. If main goroutine is non-responsive it terminates the process.
// 3. To improve debugging, after the first fatal error the other goroutines
//    are given a grace period so that we have more logs to investigate.
//
// Also implemented is a clean shutdown option, for non-error events that
// trigger clean application shutdown (e.g., a signal received from the user).
//
// The main program should call fatal.Init() when it's starting.
//
// Any library producing fatal errors should call fatal.Check() when it starts.
