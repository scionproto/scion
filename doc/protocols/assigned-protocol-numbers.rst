Assigned SCION Protocol Numbers
*******************************

.. _assigned-protocol-numbers:

This document lists the assigned SCION protocol numbers.

Considerations
==============

SCION attempts to take the `IANAâ€™s assigned internet protocol numbers
<https://perma.cc/FBE8-S2W5>`_ into consideration. Widely used protocols will
have the same protocol number. SCION specific protocol numbers start at ``200``
which makes them very unlikely to clash.

The protocol numbers are used in the :ref:`SCION Header <header-specification>`
to identify the next level protocol.
