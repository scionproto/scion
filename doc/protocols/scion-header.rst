SCION Header Specification
**************************

This document contains the specification of the SCION packet header.

SCION Header Formats
====================
Header Alignment
----------------
The SCION Header is aligned to 4 bytes.

Common Header
-------------
The Common Header has the following format:
::
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    |    PathType   |DT |DL |ST |SL |              RSV              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Version
    The version of the SCION Header. Currently, only 0 is supported.
QoS
    8-bit traffic class field. The value of the Traffic Class bits in a received
    packet or fragment might be different from the value sent by the packet's
    source. The current use of the Traffic Class field for Differentiated
    Services and Explicit Congestion Notification is specified in `RFC2474
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2474>`_ and `RFC3168
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3168>`_
FlowID
    The 20-bit FlowID field is used by a source to
    label sequences of packets to be treated in the network as a single
    flow. It is **mandatory** to be set.
NextHdr
    Field that encodes the type of the first header after the SCION header. This
    can be either a SCION extension or a layer-4 protocol such as TCP or UDP.
    Values of this field respect and extend `IANA’s assigned internet protocol
    numbers <https://perma.cc/FBE8-S2W5>`_.
HdrLen
    Length of the SCION header in bytes (i.e., the sum of the lengths of the
    common header, the address header, and the path header). All SCION header
    fields are aligned to a multiple of 4 bytes. The SCION header length is
    computed as ``HdrLen * 4 bytes``. The 8 bits of the ``HdrLen`` field limit
    the SCION header to a maximum of 1024 bytes.
PayloadLen
    Length of the payload in bytes. The payload includes extension headers and
    the L4 payload. This field is 16 bits long, supporting a maximum payload
    size of 65'535 bytes.
PathType
    The PathType specifies the SCION path type with up to 256 different types.
    The format of each path type is independent of each other. The initially
    proposed SCION path types are SCION (0), OneHopPath (1), EPIC (2) and
    COLIBRI (3). Here, we only specify the SCION and OneHopPath path types.
DT/DL/ST/SL
    DT/ST and DL/SL encode host-address type and host-address length,
    respectively, for destination/ source. The possible host address length
    values are 4 bytes, 8 bytes, 12 bytes and 16 bytes. ST and DT additionally
    specify the type of the address. If some address has a length different from
    the supported values, the next larger size can be used and the address can
    be padded with zeros.
RSV
    These bits are currently reserved for future use.

Address Header
==============
The Address Header has the following format:
::
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                 +
    |                             SrcAS                             |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    DstHostAddr (variable Len)                 |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    SrcHostAddr (variable Len)                 |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

DstISD, SrcISD
    16-bit ISD identifier of the destination/source.
DstAS, SrcAS
    48-bit AS identifier of the destination/source.
DstHostAddr, SrcHostAddr
    Variable length host address of the destination/source. The length and type
    is given by the DT/DL/ST/SL flags in the common header.

Path Type: SCION
================
The path type SCION has the following layout:
::
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                          PathMetaHdr                          |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    |                              ...                              |

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                           HopField                            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                           HopField                            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                              ...                              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+`

It consists of a path meta header, up to 3 info fields and up to 64 hop fields.

PathMeta Header
---------------

The PathMeta field is a 4 byte header containing meta information about the
SCION path contained in the path header. It has the following format:
::
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | C |  CurrHF   |    RSV    |  Seg0Len  |  Seg1Len  |  Seg2Len  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

(C)urrINF
    2-bits index (0-based) pointing to the current info field (see offset
    calculations below).
CurrHF
    6-bits index (0-based) pointing to the current hop field (see offset
    calculations below).
Seg{0,1,2}Len
    The number of hop fields in a given segment. :math:`Seg_iLen > 0` implies
    the existence of info field `i`.

Path Offset Calculations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of info fields is implied by :math:`Seg_iLen > 0,\; i \in [0,2]`,
thus :math:`NumINF = N + 1 \: \text{if}\: Seg_NLen > 0, \; N \in [2, 1, 0]`. It
is an error to have :math:`Seg_XLen > 0 \land Seg_YLen == 0, \; 2 \geq X > Y
\geq 0`. If all :math:`Seg_iLen == 0` then this denotes an empty path, which is
only valid for intra-AS communication.

The offsets of the current info field and current hop field (relative to the end
of the address header) are now calculated as

.. math::
    \begin{align}
    \text{InfoFieldOffset} &= 4B + 8B \cdot \text{CurrINF}\\
    \text{HopFieldOffset} &= 4B + 8B \cdot \text{NumINF}  + 12B \cdot
    \text{CurrHF} \end{align}

To check that the current hop field is in the segment of the current
info field, the ``CurrHF`` needs to be compared to the ``SegLen`` fields of the
current and preceding info fields.

This construction allows for up to three info fields, which is the maximum for a
SCION path. Should there ever be a path type with more than three segments, this
would require a new path type to be introduced (which would also allow for a
backwards-compatible upgrade). The advantage of this construction is that all
the offsets can be calculated and validated purely from the path meta header,
which greatly simplifies processing logic.

Info Field
----------
InfoField has the following format:
::
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |r r r r r r P C|      RSV      |             SegID             |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                           Timestamp                           |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

r
    Unused and reserved for future use.
P
    Peering flag. If set to true, then the forwarding path is built as
    a peering path, which requires special processing on the dataplane.
C
    Construction direction flag. If set to true then the hop fields are arranged
    in the direction they have been constructed during beaconing.
RSV
    Unused and reserved for future use.
SegID
    SegID is a updatable field that is required for the MAC-chaining mechanism.
Timestamp
    Timestamp created by the initiator of the corresponding beacon. The
    timestamp is expressed in Unix time, and is encoded as an unsigned integer
    within 4 bytes with 1-second time granularity.  This timestamp enables
    validation of the hop field by verification of the expiration time and MAC.

Hop Field
---------
The Hop Field has the following format:
::
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |r r r r r r I E|    ExpTime    |           ConsIngress         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |        ConsEgress             |                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               +
    |                              MAC                              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

r
    Unused and reserved for future use.
I
    ConsIngress Router Alert. If the ConsIngress Router Alert is set, the
    ingress router (in construction direction) will process the L4 payload in
    the packet.
E
    ConsEgress Router Alert. If the ConsEgress Router Alert is set, the egress
    router (in construction direction) will process the L4 payload in the
    packet.

    .. Note::

        A sender cannot rely on multiple routers retrieving and processing the
        payload even if it sets multiple router alert flags. This is entirely
        use case dependent and in the case of `SCMP traceroute` for example the
        router for which the traceroute request is intended will process it (if
        the corresponding router alert flag is set) and reply to the request
        without further forwarding the request along the path. Use cases that
        require multiple routers/hops on the path to process a packet should
        instead rely on a **hop-by-hop extension**.
ExpTime
    Expiry time of a hop field. The field is 1-byte long, thus there are 256
    different values available to express an expiration time. The expiration
    time expressed by the value of this field is relative, and an absolute
    expiration time in seconds is computed in combination with the timestamp
    field (from the corresponding info field) as follows

    .. math::
        Timestamp + (1 + ExpTime) \cdot \frac{24\cdot60\cdot60}{256}

ConsIngress, ConsEgress
    The 16-bits ingress/egress interface IDs in construction direction.
MAC
    6-byte Message Authentication Code to authenticate the hop field. For details on how this MAC is calculated refer to `Hop Field MAC Computation`_.

Hop Field MAC Computation
-------------------------
The MAC in each hop field has two purposes:

#. Authentication of the information contained in the hop field itself, in
   particular ``ExpTime``, ``ConsIngress``, and ``ConsEgress``.
#. Prevention of addition, removal, or reordering hops within a path segment
   created during beaconing.

To that end, MACs are calculated over the relevant fields of a hop field and
additionally (conceptually) chained to other hop fields in the path segment. In
the following, we specify the computation of a hop field MAC.

We write the *i*-th  hop field in a path segment (in construction direction) as

.. math::
    HF_i = \langle  Flags_i || ExpTime_i || InIF_i || EgIF_i || \sigma_i \rangle

:math:`\sigma_i` is the hop field MAC calculate as

.. math::
    \sigma_i = \text{MAC}_{K_i}(TS || ExpTime_i || InIF_i || EgIF_i || \beta_i)

where *TS* is the `Timestamp` and :math:`\beta_i` is the current ``SegID`` of
the info field. :math:`\beta_i` changes at each hop according to the following
rules:

.. math::
    \begin{align}
    \beta_0 &= \text{RND}()\\
    \beta_{i+1} &= \beta_i \oplus \sigma_i[:2]
    \end{align}

Here, :math:`\sigma_i[:2]` is the hop field MAC truncated to 2 bytes and
:math:`\oplus` denotes bitwise XOR.

During beaconing, the initial random value :math:`\beta_0` can be stored in the
info field and all subsequent segment identifiers can be added to the respective
hop entries, i.e., :math:`\beta_{i+1}` can be added to the *i*-th hop entry. On
the data plane, the `SegID` field must contain :math:`\beta_{i+1}/\beta_i` for a
segment in up/down direction before being processed at the *i*th hop (this also
applies to core segments).

Peering Links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Peering hop fields can still be "chained" to the AS' standard up/down hop field
via the use of :math:`\beta_{i+1}`:

.. math::
    \begin{align}
    HF^P_i &= \langle  Flags^P_i || ExpTime^P_i || InIF^P_i || EgIF^P_i ||
    \sigma^P_i \rangle\\
    \sigma^P_i &= \text{MAC}_{K_i}(TS || ExpTime^P_i || InIF^P_i || EgIF^P_i || \beta_{i+1})
    \end{align}

Path Calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Initialization**

The paths must be initialized correctly for the border routers to verify the hop
fields in the data plane. `SegID` is an updatable field and is initialized based
on the location of sender in relation to path construction.



Initialization cases:

- The non-peering path segment is traversed in construction direction. It starts
  at the `i`-th AS of the full segment discovered in beaconing:

  :math:`SegID := \beta_{i}`

- The peering path segment is traversed in construction direction. It starts at
  the `i`-th AS of the full segment discovered in beaconing:

  :math:`SegID := \beta_{i+1}`

- The path segment is traversed against construction direction. The full segment
  discovered in beaconing has `n` hops:

  :math:`SegID := \beta_{n}`

**AS Traversal Operations**

Each AS on the path verifies the hop fields with the help of the current value
in `SegID`. The operations differ based on the location of the AS on the path.
Each AS has to set the `SegID` correctly for the next AS to verify its hop
field. These operations also have to be done by ASes that deliver the packet
to a local end host to ensure that path can be used in the reverse direction.

Each operation is described form the perspective of AS `i`.

Against construction direction (up, i.e., ConsDir == 0):
   #. `SegID` contains :math:`\beta_{i+1}` at this point.
   #. Compute :math:`\beta'_{i} := SegID \oplus \sigma_i[:2]`
   #. Compute :math:`\sigma'_i` with the formula above by replacing
      :math:`\beta_{i}` with :math:`\beta'_{i}`.
   #. Check that the MAC in the hop field matches :math:`\sigma'_{i}`.
   #. Update `SegID` for the next hop:

      :math:`SegID := \beta'_{i}`
   #. `SegID` now contains :math:`\beta_{i}`.

In construction direction (down, i.e., ConsDir == 1):
   #. `SegID` contains :math:`\beta_{i}` at this point.
   #. Compute :math:`\sigma'_i` with the formula above by replacing
      :math:`\beta_{i}` with `SegID`.
   #. Check that the MAC in the hop field matches :math:`\sigma'_{i}`.
   #. Update `SegID` for the next hop:

      :math:`SegID := SegID \oplus \sigma_i[:2]`
   #. `SegID` now contains :math:`\beta_{i+1}`.

The computation for ASes where a peering link is crossed between path segments
is special cased. A path containing a peering link contains exactly two path
segments, one in construction direction (down) and one against construction
direction (up). On the path segment in construction direction, the peering AS is
the first hop of the segment. Against construction direction (up), the peering
AS is the last hop of the segment.

Against construction direction (up):
   #. `SegID` contains :math:`\beta_{i+1}` at this point.
   #. Compute :math:`{\sigma^P_i}'` with the formula above by replacing
      :math:`\beta_{i+1}` with `SegID`.
   #. Check that the MAC in the hop field matches :math:`{\sigma^P_i}'`.
   #. Do not update `SegID` as it already contains :math:`\beta_{i+1}`.

In construction direction (down):
   #. `SegID` contains :math:`\beta_{i+1}` at this point.
   #. Compute :math:`{\sigma^P_i}'` with the formula above by replacing
      :math:`\beta_{i+1}` with `SegID`.
   #. Check that the MAC in the hop field matches :math:`{\sigma^P_i}'`.
   #. Do not update `SegID` as it already contains :math:`\beta_{i+1}`.

Path Type: OneHopPath
=====================

The OneHopPath path type is a special case of the SCION path type. It is used to
handle communication between two entities from neighboring ASes that do not have
a forwarding path. Currently, it's only used for bootstrapping beaconing between
neighboring ASes.

A OneHopPath has exactly one info field and two hop fields with the speciality
that the second hop field is not known apriori, but is instead created by the
corresponding BR upon processing of the OneHopPath.

Because of its special structure, no PathMeta header is needed. There is only a
single info field and the appropriate hop field can be processed by a border
router based on the source and destination address, i.e., ``if srcIA == self.IA:
CurrHF := 0`` and ``if dstIA == self.IA: CurrHF := 1``.
