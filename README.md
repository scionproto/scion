Welcome to the open-source implementation of
[SCION](http://www.scion-architecture.net) (Scalability, Control and Isolation
On next-generation Networks), a future Internet architecture. SCION is the first
clean-slate Internet architecture designed to provide route control, failure
isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communication. To find
out more about the project, please visit our [documentation
site](https://docs.scion.org/en/latest/).
