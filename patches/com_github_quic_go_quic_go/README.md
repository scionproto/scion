# quic-go patches

The [ignore.patch](./ignore.patch) ignores the qtls-go1-20 dependency that is
generated by gazelle. qtls-go1-20 requires Go version 1.20, and is hidden behind
a build tag that gazelle ignores. Bazel then tries to build qtls-go1-20 with Go 1.19,
which obviously does not work.

This patch can be removed as soon as we update the Go version.
