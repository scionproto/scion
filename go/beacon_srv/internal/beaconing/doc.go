// Package beaconing implements tasks and handlers related to beacon propagation
// and registration.
//
// Handler
//
// Call NewHandler to create a beacon handler that implements infra.Handler. The
// handler validates the received beacon and verifies all signatures. If
// successful, the beacon is added to the beacon store.
//
// Originator
//
// The originator should only be instantiated by core beacon servers. It
// periodically creates fresh beacons and propagates them on all core and child
// links. In case the task is run before a full period has passed, beacons are
// originated on all interfaces that have last been originated on more than one
// period ago.
//
// Registrar
//
// The registrar is a periodic task to register segments with the appropriate
// path server. Core and Up segments are registered with the local path server.
// Down segments are registered with the originating core AS. In case the task
// is run before a full period has passed, segments are only registered, if
// there has not been a successful registration in the last period.
//
// Propagator
//
// The propagator is a periodic task to propagate beacons to the appropriate
// neighboring ASes. In a core AS, the beacons are propagated to the neighbors
// on all core link, unless they will create an AS loop. In a non-core AS, the
// beacons are propagated to the neighbors on all child links. In case the task
// is run before a full period has passed, beacons are propagated on all
// interfaces that have last been propagated on more than one period ago.
