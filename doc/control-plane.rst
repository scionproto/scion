Introduction
============

The SCION control plane is responsible for discovering path segments and making them available to
endpoints. This includes path-segment exploration (also called "beaconing"), registration, lookup,
and finally the combination of path-segments to end-to-end paths.

.. Note: content based on (extracts from) IETF draft draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-00.

The **control service** is responsible for the path exploration and registration processes in the
control plane.
It is the main control-plane infrastructure component within each SCION :term:`AS`.
The control service of an AS has the following tasks:

- Generating, receiving, and propagating :term:`Path Construction Beacons (PCBs) <PCB>`.
  Periodically, the control service of a core AS generates a set of PCBs, which are forwarded to the
  child ASes or neighboring core ASes.
  In the latter case, the PCBs are sent over policy-compliant paths to discover multiple paths
  between any pair of core ASes.
- Selecting and registering the set of path segments via which the AS wants to be reached.
- Managing certificates and keys to secure inter-AS communication.
  Each PCB contains signatures of all on-path ASes.
  Every time the control service of an AS receives a PCB, it validates the PCB's authenticity.
  When the control service lacks an intermediate certificate, it can query the control service of
  the neighboring AS that sent the PCB.

Path Segments
-------------

As described previously, the main goal of SCION's control plane is to create and manage path
segments, which can then be combined into forwarding paths to transmit packets in the data plane.
SCION distinguishes the following types of path segments:

- A path segment from a non-core AS to a core AS is an *up-segment*.
- A path segment from a core AS to a non-core AS is a *down-segment*.
- A path segment between core ASes is a *core-segment*.

So each path segment either ends at a core AS, or starts at a core AS, or both.

.. note::

   There are no SCION path segments that start and end at a non-core AS. However, when combining
   path segments into an end-to-end SCION path, shortcuts and peering-links can be used.

All path segments are reversible: A core-segment can be used bidirectionally, and an up-segment can
be converted into a down-segment, or vice versa, depending on the direction of the end-to-end path.
This means that all path segments can be used to send data traffic in both directions.

.. _control-plane-beaconing:

Path Exploration (Beaconing)
============================

**Path exploration** is the process where an AS discovers paths to other ASes. In SCION, this
process is referred to as *beaconing*.

In SCION, the *control service* of each AS is responsible for the beaconing process.
The control service generates, receives, and propagates *path-segment construction beacons (PCBs)*
on a regular basis, to iteratively construct path segments.
PCBs contain topology and authentication information, and can also include additional metadata that
helps with path management and selection.
The beaconing process itself is divided into routing processes on two levels, where *inter-ISD* or
core beaconing is based on the (selective) sending of PCBs without a defined direction, and
*intra-ISD* beaconing on top-to-bottom propagation.
This division of routing levels is a key architectural decision of SCION and important for achieving
a better scalability.

- *Inter-ISD or core beaconing* is the process of constructing path segments between core ASes in
  the same or in different ISDs. During core beaconing, the control service of a core AS either
  initiates PCBs or propagates PCBs received from neighboring core ASes to other neighboring core
  ASes. Core beaconing is periodic; PCBs are sent over policy-compliant paths to discover multiple
  paths between any pair of core ASes.
- *Intra-ISD beaconing* creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes. For this, the control
  service of a core AS creates PCBs and sends them to the non-core child ASes (typically customer
  ASes). The control service of a non-core child AS receives these PCBs and forwards them to its
  child ASes, and so on. This procedure continues until the PCB reaches an AS without any customer
  (leaf AS). As a result, all ASes within an ISD receive path segments to reach the core ASes of
  their ISD.

On its way, a PCB accumulates cryptographically protected path- and forwarding information per
traversed AS. At every AS, metadata as well as information about the AS's ingress and egress
interfaces are added to the PCB.

Origination of PCBs
-------------------

Every core AS originates PCBs at regular intervals, and sends these to all egress interfaces to
connected neighbor ASes.
An originated PCB sent to a neighboring core ASes initiates an inter-ISD beacon, ultimately
resulting in a core-segment.
An originated PCB sent to a child AS initiates the intra-ISD beacon creating an up/down segment.

Propagation of PCBs
-------------------

PCBs are propgated at regular intervals at each AS.
When PCBs are received, they are not propagated immediately, but put into temporary storage
until the next propagation event.
The selection and propagation of PCBs differs between the inter-ISD and intra-ISD beacon schemes.

Core ASes implement the inter-ISD / core beaconing scheme.
For every interface connecting to a neighboring core AS:

1. Select the best :math:`N` PCBs for each origin core AS.
   This can take into account both the available PCBs as well as local policies and information
   about the link to the neighbor.
2. Extend the selected PCBs by adding an *AS entry*
3. Send the extended PCBs over the interface

Non-core ASes implement the intra-ISD / non-core beaconing scheme.
For every interface connecting to a child AS:

1. Select the best :math:`N` PCBs.
   This can take into account both the available PCBs as well as local policies and information
   about the link to the child AS.
2. Extend the selected PCBs by adding an *AS entry*
3. Send the extended PCBs over the interface

AS Entries
----------

Every AS adds a signed *AS entry* to the PCBs it originates, propagates or :ref:`registers <control-plane-registration>`.

This AS entry includes the relevant network topology information for this AS-hop
defined by the ingress and egress :term:`interface IDs <Interface ID>` of the beacon.
The so-called *hop field* includes a MAC that authorizes the use of this hop in the path
segment defined by the PCB, until it expires.
See the description of the :ref:`SCION Path <path-type-scion>` in the data plane section for more
details on the hop field format and the MAC chaining mechanism.

Additionally, an AS entry can contain :doc:`metadata <beacon-metadata>` such as the link MTU,
geographic locations of the AS routers, latencies, etc.

For illustration, the following code blocks show the definition of the protobuf message definitions
for the AS entry "body" and the contained hop field information.
This is just a small excerpt of the relevant definitions.

Peering Links
-------------

PCBs do not traverse peering links.
Instead, available peering links are announced along with a regular path in the individual AS
entries of PCBs.
If both ASes at either end of a peering link have registered path segments that include a specific
peering link, then it can be used to during segment combination to create an end-to-end path.

.. _control-plane-registration:

Registration of Path Segments
=============================

**Path registration** is the process where an AS transforms selected PCBs into path segments,
"terminating" them by adding a final AS entry with a zero egress interface,
and adds these segments to the relevant path databases, thus making them available for the path
lookup process.

As mentioned previously, a non-core AS typically receives several PCBs representing path segments to
the core ASes of the ISD the AS belongs to.
Out of these PCBs, the non-core AS selects those down-path segments through which it wants to be
reached, based on AS-specific selection critera.
The next step is to register the selected down-segments with the control service of the
core AS that originated the PCB.

Intra-ISD Path-Segment Registration
-----------------------------------

Every *registration period* (determined by each AS), the AS's control service selects of
PCBs to transform into path segments:

- Up-segments, which allow the infrastructure entities and endpoints in this AS to communicate with
  core ASes.
  Up-segments are registered in the local path database of the AS.
- Down-segments, which allow remote entities to reach this AS.
  Down-segments are registered, via a remote-procedure call, in the path-segment database of the
  core AS that originated the PCB.
  As a result, a core AS's path database contains all down-segments registered by their
  direct or indirect customer ASes.

Core Path-Segment Registration
------------------------------

The core beaconing process creates PCBs from core AS to core AS.
Every *registration period*, the AS's control service selects sets of PCBs to turn into path
segments and register.
These selected core-segments are added to the local path database of the core AS that created the
segment (i.e. the one at the end of the beacon chain), so that local and remote endpoints can obtain
and use these core-segments.
In contrast to the down-segment registration procedure, there is no need to register core-segments
with other core ASes (as each core AS will receive PCBs originated from every other core AS).

Path Lookup
===========

An endpoint (source) that wants to start communication with another endpoint (destination), needs
up to three path segments:

- An up-path segment to reach the core of the source ISD
- a core-path segment to reach

  - another core AS in the source ISD, in case the destination AS is in the same source ISD, or
  - a core AS in a remote ISD, if the destination AS is in another ISD, and

- a down-path segment to reach the destination AS.

The process to look up and fetch path segments consists of the following steps:

1. First, the source endpoint queries the control service in its own AS (i.e., the source AS) for
   the required segments.
   The control service has up-path segments stored in its path database.
2. The control service in the source AS queries the control services of the reachable core ASes in
   the source ISD, for core-path segments to core ASes in the destination ISD (which is either the
   local or a remote ISD).
   To reach the core control services, the control service of the source AS uses the locally stored
   up-path segments.
3. The control service then queries the control services of the remote core ASes in the destination
   ISD, to fetch down-path segments to the destination AS.
   To reach the remote core ASes, the control service of the source AS uses the previously obtained
   and combined up- and core segments.
4. Finally, the control service of the source AS returns all retrieved path segments to the source
   endpoint.
5. The endpoint combines all path segments into an end-to-end path

All remote path-segment lookups by the control service are cached.

On SCION end hosts, a :doc:`SCION daemon <manuals/daemon>` is usually employed to do the
path-lookup on behalf of applications. This SCION daemon also caches path-segment lookup results.

.. table:: Control services responsible for different types of path segments

   ============ ===========================
   Segment Type Responsible control service(s)
   ============ ===========================
   Up-segment   Control service of the source AS
   Core-segment Control service of core ASes in source ISD
   Down-segment Control service of core ASes in destination ISD (either the local ISD or a remote ISD)
   ============ ===========================

.. _control-plane-segment-combination:

Path-Segment Combination
========================

The last step of the path-resolution process is to combine the available up-, core- and down-
path segments to end-to-end forwarding paths.
This path-segment combination process is done by each endpoint separately.
Typically, end hosts run the :doc:`SCION daemon <manuals/daemon>` which centralizes the
path-resolution process and returns fully formed end-to-end paths to applications.
However, applications could also choose to bypass the daemon and perform the path-resolution
directly.

The figures below illustrate the various ways in which segments can be combined
to form end-to-end paths.
See the description of the :ref:`SCION Path<path-type-scion>` for the specifics on how these
end-to-end paths are encoded in the packet header.
