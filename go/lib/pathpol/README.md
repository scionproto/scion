This directory contains the sequence parser. The parser was generated by Antlr and stored in this
git repository, in the `sequence` subdirectory. That way the project doesn't have a build dependency
on Antlr tool. However, there's still the dependency on Antlr runtime library.

If sequence grammar (`Sequence.g4`) is changed the parser has to be regenerated.
To do so, install Antlr on your machine, and run `make` in this directory.
