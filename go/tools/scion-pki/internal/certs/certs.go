var CmdCerts = &base.Command{
	Name: "certs",
	Run:  runCert,
	UsageLine: `certs [-h] (gen|renew|template|clean) [<flags>] <selector>

	Short: "Generate and renew certificate chains for the SCION control plane PKI.",
	Long: `
'certs' can be used to generate and renew certificate chains for the SCION control plane PKI.

Subcommands:
	gen
		Used to generate new certificates.
	renew (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
		Used to renew existing certificates.
	clean (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
		Used to clean all the certificates.

Flags:
	-d
		The root directory of all certificates and keys (default '.')
	-f
		Overwrite existing certificates (and keys if -genkeys is specified).
	-verify (default TRUE)
		Also verify the generated/renewed certificates.

Selector:
	*-*
		All ISDs and ASes under the root directory.
	X-*
		All ASes in ISD X.
	X-Y
		A specific AS X-Y, e.g. AS 1-4_294_967_300

'certs' needs to be pointed to the root directory where all keys and certificates are
stored on disk (-d flag). It expects the contents of the root directory to follow
a predefined structure:
	<root>/
		ISD1/
			isd.ini
			AS1/
				as.ini
				certs/
				keys/
			AS2/
			...
		ISD2/
			AS1/
			...
		...

as.ini contains the preconfigured parameters according to which 'certs' generates
the certificates. It follows the ini format and must contain a "AS Certificate"
section and in case of a core AS also a "Issuer Certificate" section that can
contain the following values:
	Issuer [required]
		string identifying the entity that signed the certificate. An AS is
		represented as a string ISD-AS (e.g., 1-4_294_967_300). This is only
		needed in the "AS Certificate" section.
	TRCVersion [required]
		integer representing the version of TRC that the issuer used at the time of
		signing the certificate.
	Version [required]
		integer representing the version of the certificate
	Comment [optional]
		arbitrary string used to describe the AS and certificate
	Validity [required]
		the validity of the certificate as a duration string, e.g., 180d or 36h
	IssuingTime (now) [optional]
		the time the certificate was issued as a UNIX timestamp
	EncAlgorithm (curve25519xalsa20poly1305) [optional]
		cryptographic algorithm that must be used to encrypt/decrypt a message
		with the subject’s public/private key
	SignAlgorithm (ed25519) [optional]
		cryptographic algorithm that must be used to sign/verify a message with
		the subject’s private/public key.
