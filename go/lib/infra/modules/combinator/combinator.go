// Combine constructs paths between src and dst using the supplied
// segments. All possible paths are first computed, and then filtered according
// to filterLongPaths.
//
// Normally, with findAllIdentical=false, Combine returns one path for each
// unique sequence of path interfaces found. If there are multiple ways to
// construct the same sequence of path interfaces from the available path
// segments, the construction with latest expiration time will be returned.
//
// With findAllIdentical=true, Combine may return multiple paths with identical
// sequences of path interfaces, but constructed from different path segments.
// These forwarding paths can only be destinguished by the segment IDs and the
// hop field MACs. Typically, all of these will have exactly the same
// forwarding behaviour, but it is possible that an AS would misbehave and
// change behaviour based on the segment IDs or MACs. An application can use
// findAllIdentical=true in order to explore whether this may be the case.
// Note that this may return a large number of paths for wide network
// topologies.
//
// The remaining paths are returned sorted according to
// weight (on equal weight, see pathSolutionList.Less for the tie-breaking
// algorithm).
//
// If Combine cannot extract a hop field or info field from the segments, it
// panics.
