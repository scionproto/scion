    fiction, they exist only in the routers configuration.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1 - Configure your subject router according to accept/router_benchmark/conf/router.toml")
    If using openwrt, an easy way to do that is to install the bmtools.ipk package. In addition,
    bmtools includes two microbenchmarks: scion-coremark and scion-mmbm. Those will run
    automatically and the results will be used to improve the benchmark report.

    Optinal: If you did not install bmtools.ipk, install and run those microbenchmark and make a
    note of the results: (scion-coremark; scion-mmbm).

2 - Configure the following interfaces on your router (The procedure depends on your router
    UI):
    - One physical interface with addresses: {", ".join(multiplexed)}
{nl.join(['    - One physical interface with address: ' + s for s in exclusives])}

    IMPORTANT: if you're using a partitioned network (eg. multiple switches or no switches),
    the "must reach" annotation matters. The 'h' number is the order in which the corresponding host
    interface must be given on the command line in step 7.

3 - Connect the corresponding ports into your test switch (best if dedicated for the test).

4 - Restart the scion-router service.

5 - Pick the same number of physical interfaces on the system where you are running this
    script. Make sure that these interface aren't used for anything else and have no assigned
    IP addresses. Make a note of their names and, if using a partitioned network, associate each
    with one of the numbers from step 2.

6 - Connect the corresponding ports into your test switch. If using a partitioned network, make
    sure that port is reachable by the corresponding subject router port.

7 - Execute this script with arguments: --run <interfaces>, where <interfaces> is the list
    of names you collected in step 5. If using a partitioned network, make sure to supply them
    in the order indicated in step 2.

    If coremak and mmbm values are available, the report will include a performance index.

    If coremark and mmbm are not available from the test subject, you may supply them on the command
    line. To that end, add the following arguments: "--coremark=<coremark>", "--mmbm=<mmbm>", where
    <coremark> and <mmbm> are the results you optionally collected in step 1.

8 - Be patient...

9 - Read the report.
