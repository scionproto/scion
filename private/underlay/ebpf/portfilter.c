// This tells our bpf program which port goes to the AF_PACKET socket.

// of allowed port numbers. Those must be in network byte order.

// Since AF_PACKET ports receive cloned traffic, we can just drop everything
// we don't want and the regular networking stack will get it.
//
// This is far from ideal because I have yet to find a way to dispatch traffic
// before it is cloned for AF_PACKET handling but after it is turned into an
// SKB. To solve that problem we need to go to XDP.
//
// This might not be as bad as it looks though: traffic is cloned via c-o-w
// and it might even not be cloned until the AF_PACKET tap has made a
// drop/keep decision. The traffic that we keep is definitely cloned; so...
// dear cow, a third swiss industry is now counting on you.
