:mod:`types` --- SCMP types
===========================
All SCMP packets have:

- An extension header, to mark the packet as an SCMP packet, which contains:

  - A hop-by-hop flag, to indicate if routers should process the SCMP payload.
  - An error flag, to indicate if an error while processing this packet should
    generate an SCMP error packet.

- An SCMP l4 header, which contains:

  - Error Class (General/Routing/etc) - a group of error types.
  - Error Type (ECHO_REQUEST/UNREACH_NET/etc).
  - Timestamp of the time the header was created.
  - Length (in bytes) of the SCMP l4 header + SCMP payload.
  - Checksum over pseudoheader, SCMP l4 header and SCMP payload.

- An SCMP payload, which contains:

  - Meta data about the sizes of the various contents of the payload.
  - (For some error class/types) An SCMP Info field, which contains:

    - Any additional information needed to process the payload data.

  - Sections of the original packet's headers, to allow inspection of the
    problem, and also to identify the origin of the packet that caused the
    error. (Except in the case of echo request/reply, where the data here is
    supplied by the application, and is not processed).

All SCMP error packets must contain the following sections of the original
packet (referred to as "basic" below):

- Common header
- Address header
- L4 header, if any

This is to allow the original sender to be identified, and the SCMP error to
be delivered to them.
Some other sections are required, depending on the exact error class/type:

- Path header
- Extension headers
